** Dream 11 Prediction Project**

 Overview

This project aims to predict the Dream 11 score of players in IPL matches using machine learning techniques. Dream 11 is a fantasy sports platform where users create their own virtual teams and earn points based on the real-life performance of players in matches.

 Dataset

The dataset (`IPL.csv`) used in this project contains detailed match statistics including player performances such as runs scored, wickets taken, catches, and stumpings. Each row represents a player's performance in a particular match.

 Project Structure

- Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and prepared for analysis. Columns are renamed for clarity and missing data is handled appropriately.
  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Statistical summaries, visualizations, and hypothesis tests are conducted to understand player performances and identify top performers.

- Machine Learning Model: A linear regression model is implemented to predict the Dream 11 score of players. Historical data from the dataset is used to train and evaluate the model.

- Visualization: Various visualizations such as bar plots, pie charts, and line plots are used to illustrate top scorers, fielders, and other insights derived from the data.

 Tools Used

- Python: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.
- Scikit-learn: Used for implementing the linear regression model.
- Jupyter Notebook: Used for interactive development and documentation of the project.

 Usage

1. Setup: Ensure Python and required libraries are installed (`pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn`).
   
2. Data Loading: Place the `IPL.csv` dataset in the project directory.

3. Execution: Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to execute the code. Follow the instructions to enter the player's name for which the Dream 11 score prediction is needed.
